# Algorithmic projects

This repository contains a collection of algorithmic projects implemented in C++ during the second semester of my studies for Algorithms and Data Structures course. The purpose of these projects is to provide practical implementation experience with various data structures. Each project focuses on a specific data structure and includes relevant algorithms and operations.
## Projects

The following projects are included in this repository:
1. **B-tree**: Implementation of a B-tree data structure with insertion, search, and traversal operations.
2. **Files on Pendrives**: A program for organizing files on pendrives based on their sizes and IDs. The program sorts the files according to their sizes and distributes them among two pendrives, considering a given maximum size constraint.
3. **List-based FIFO queue**: This program implements a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue using a linked list. The queue supports operations like adding elements to the front and end of the queue, printing the elements in forward and backward order, popping the front element, and performing garbage collection to remove unused elements.
4. **XOR linked list**: A program that demonstrates the XOR linked list data structure with various operations for adding, printing, and deleting elements.
